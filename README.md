# Template Repository

## About
A collection of various templates and other documents I use to create my repositories. These files are organized by project type. Also included is a list of badges that I frequently use. These badges are produced at [Shields.io](https://shields.io/)

## Usage
Include instructions on how to use different files here.

## Acknowledgements
Many of these documents were based off of [The Documentation Compendium](https://github.com/kylelobo/The-Documentation-Compendium).
